# Winsudo

`Welcome to Winsudo.`
> Winsudo is a system built with .bat files to create a system where commands are run with admin permissions.


Winsudo is currently under development, and may be changed completely. we suggest updating your winsudo version to another folder in your computer first to see if it works the way you used it.


## What does it do?

> Winsudo auto-elevates itself to run .bat files as admin just like in linux.

## Winsudo says i need to install dependencies

> Winsudo uses these dependencies to function. You need to execute `sudo --i` to install these.


## What is 'admin' in winsudo's directory?

> Winsudo Admin is the SYSTEM@system in windows for sudo. It basically runs as SYSTEM in windows, with the ability to do ANYTHING!
> From **deleting System32** to **Editing cmd.exe**
